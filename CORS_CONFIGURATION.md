# CORS Configuration Changes for M-Mart E-commerce Project

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to fix Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues in the M-Mart Nigerian e-commerce platform. These changes allow the React frontend to communicate properly with the Laravel backend API.

## Files Modified

We edited three files to resolve the CORS issues:

### 1. config/cors.php

**Location:** `/Users/ITAdmin/Documents/checkout mmart/livebackend/config/cors.php`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated the `allowed_origins` array to include all frontend origins:
  ```php
  // From:
  'allowed_origins' => ['http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173, http://127.0.0.1:58566'],
  
  // To:
  'allowed_origins' => ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:5173', 'http://127.0.0.1:58566'],
  ```

**Purpose:**
- This is Laravel's main CORS configuration file
- The change allows requests from all three possible frontend origins
- Each origin is now properly separated as individual array elements

### 2. app/Http/Kernel.php

**Location:** `/Users/ITAdmin/Documents/checkout mmart/livebackend/app/Http/Kernel.php`

**Changes Made:**
- Commented out the custom CORS middleware:
  ```php
  // From:
  \App\Http\Middleware\Cors::class,
  
  // To:
  //\App\Http\Middleware\Cors::class,
  ```

**Purpose:**
- Prevents conflicts between two CORS middleware running simultaneously
- Relies on Laravel's built-in CORS middleware (`\Illuminate\Http\Middleware\HandleCors::class`)
- Eliminates potential middleware conflicts that could cause CORS issues

### 3. app/Http/Middleware/Cors.php

**Location:** `/Users/ITAdmin/Documents/checkout mmart/livebackend/app/Http/Middleware/Cors.php`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to include all frontend origins:
  ```php
  // From:
  $response->headers->set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173, http://127.0.0.1:58566');
  
  // To:
  $response->headers->set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173, http://127.0.0.1:58566');
  ```

**Purpose:**
- Although this middleware is now commented out in the Kernel, we updated it for completeness
- If the middleware is ever re-enabled, it will have the correct configuration

## Impact of Changes

These changes enable:

1. **Authentication**: The React frontend can now make API calls to the Laravel backend for user login and registration
2. **Data Access**: API calls for product and category data will work when implemented
3. **Checkout Process**: The checkout functionality can now communicate with the backend

## Additional Context

- The M-Mart frontend is built with React, React Router, Context API, and Tailwind CSS
- The project is a Nigerian e-commerce platform using Naira (₦) as its currency
- While authentication now works with real API calls, product display still uses mock data in the frontend

## Next Steps

After these CORS fixes, the team should:

1. Replace mock product data with real API calls to display actual database products
2. Ensure the checkout process works with real products from the database
3. Test the complete user flow from browsing to checkout with the Nigerian Naira (₦) currency
